# BuildOS
Building my own OS (Great-X OS)

   -- Made in Indonesia --
    [ Project OS 'n BIOS ]

note++: this project not will fully finished due to school, youtube contents, etc.

note: Order to run this BIOS 'n OS, you need to run in a Microsoft / Windows OS (use VM if you're on Apple OS)
      also use this on a usb / flashdrive for a better spec (or a folder)

      why? you might ask...

      well if see, i made a file that when this init DRIVE/FOLDER clicked autoruns the SETUP.EXE/SETUP.CMD/SETUP.BAT file
      and also run the BIOS + OS

      specs: 
            RAM: 128b
            ROM: 32b

            and MEMORY: 1Kb
